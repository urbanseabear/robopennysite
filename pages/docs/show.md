# Show

## ^show <server> <character name>

shows character data from the lodestone utilizing XIVAPI.  slow lookup due to having to search for character on server in order to get the character's ID to get the bulk of the lodestone data.  Will eventually add character caching to speed this lookup up and also make it better looking with canvas instead of direct discord embed.

### Example : ^show goblin Penny Ura
